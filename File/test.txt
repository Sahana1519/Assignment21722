In academic writing, 
paragraphs will usually consist of the “standard” 100 – 200 words (Burns, 2002).
You will begin the paragraph with an idea and then explain it in the light of currently accepted knowledge (Phillips, 2014) with references. 
Bear in mind that your tutor will want to see some original thought, but will expect it to be motivated according to your reading (Williams et al, 1994).
Smith (2004) supports this concept and confirms that academic writing requires longer paragraphs than those generally found in commercial writing or even story-telling. 
200 words is really a bit long for any paragraph and since this one is just over 100 words, 
you’ll soon see why this should be the case (Me, 2015).
